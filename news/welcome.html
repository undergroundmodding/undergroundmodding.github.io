      <p>Welcome to the news tab, this will be used for updates and changes to our site and for many other things, as of right now (October 22nd 2025) there won't be much on this tab for a bit as this website is pretty much useless and in a testing phase at the moment. I hope to get this website fully up and running very soon and then there might be a chance of something happening on here and in our discord (feel free to join!) so thats pretty much it for now.
